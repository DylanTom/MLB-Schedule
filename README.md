# MLB Schedule Project
## Dylan Tom - Summer 2021
### Problem Statement
The central problem in this project is (1) attempting to optimize the MLB schedule that optimizes profit and (2) create a schedule that complies to all constraints set forth by the MLB and CPA. The primary method initially attempted is using a machine learning optimization technique. Initially, I want to accomplish this using stochastic gradient descent as the chosen method of optimization.
